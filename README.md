This is a simple static website . Have taken one website template and deployed on aws s3 bucket by enabling cloud front for Faster Content Delivery and reducing latency. Deployment is done through aws code pipeline as a CICD tool.

So when a user searches by the domain  URL, the content in the s3 bucket is visible  by accessing through cloud front.
